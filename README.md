# SQL-Project-International-Students-Mental-Health-and-Length-of-Stay
Exploring the impact of studying abroad and length of stay on international students' mental health using SQL. Analyzed depression (PHQ-9), social connectedness (SCS), and acculturative stress (ASISS) scores to identify trends. Completed as part of the Intermediate SQL course on DataCamp.
## Introduction
This project analyzes the mental health of international students at a Japanese university, focusing on how the length of stay in a foreign country impacts their well-being. Using SQL, I examined the relationship between the duration of stay and key mental health indicators such as depression (PHQ-9), social connectedness (SCS), and acculturative stress (ASISS).

The dataset includes information about student demographics, academic level, language proficiency, and the results of mental health assessments. The goal of this project is to provide insights that may help universities develop targeted interventions to support international students.

## Analysis
### Key Insights:
#### Length of Stay and Depression (PHQ-9):

The average PHQ-9 scores, which measure depression levels, varied across different lengths of stay. Higher scores indicated more severe depression.
#### Social Connectedness (SCS):

The SCS scores fluctuated based on the length of stay, with higher scores indicating stronger social connectedness. Longer stays appeared to correlate with better social integration.
#### Acculturative Stress (ASISS):

The ASISS scores, which measure acculturative stress, were influenced by the duration of stay, with shorter stays tending to result in higher levels of stress related to cultural adaptation.
_The SQL analysis looked at the average scores for these mental health indicators, grouped by the studentsâ€™ length of stay._

## Findings
#### Depression
Students with shorter stays had higher average depression scores, suggesting that less time to acclimate may contribute to poorer mental health.
Social Connectedness: Students who stayed longer showed higher levels of social connectedness, possibly due to increased opportunities for social interaction and cultural adaptation.
#### Acculturative Stress
Higher acculturative stress was observed in students with shorter stays, as they likely had less time to adjust to the new environment.
## Conclusion
The analysis reveals a clear relationship between the length of stay and various aspects of mental health in international students. Students who stay longer tend to experience lower levels of depression and acculturative stress, while also developing stronger social connections. These findings suggest that universities should consider offering additional support to students who are in the early stages of their stay abroad.
